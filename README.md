### This small project to practice SQL Window functions queries using as summary

*This project is made to practice using SQL window functions on PostgreSQL*

*My coclussion about window functions*

*The key benefit of using WF is that it does not output single line summaries for aggregate data. This means that when we execute a query, WF will produce all lines with an additional column for our aggregation.*
